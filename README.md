# DESCRIPTION ABOUT MY PROJECT 

In this task, a Decision Tree Classifier was implemented using scikit-learn to classify flower species from the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is one of the most widely used datasets in machine learning and contains 150 samples distributed across three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four numerical features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—which serve as input variables for the model.

The project began by importing essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. The Iris dataset was loaded and converted into a Pandas DataFrame to make the data easier to analyze. The dataset was then divided into training and testing subsets, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing, ensuring a fair evaluation of the model’s performance.

A Decision Tree Classifier with a maximum depth of 3 was created to maintain model simplicity and prevent overfitting. The model was trained on the training dataset using the .fit() method and later tested on the unseen test dataset using .predict(). The evaluation metrics, including accuracy score and classification report, showed excellent results, typically achieving between 95% and 100% accuracy. This indicates that the model effectively distinguishes between the three flower species.

A key part of this task was visualizing the trained decision tree using the plot_tree() function. The visualization displays how the model makes decisions based on feature thresholds such as petal length and petal width. It also shows Gini impurity, class distribution, and the number of samples at each node. The tree is easy to interpret and demonstrates how decision rules are formed step-by-step.

Overall, this task successfully demonstrates the complete process of building, training, evaluating, and visualizing a Decision Tree model. The project highlights the model’s strong performance and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for classification tasks.
